<h1>B21 Task Planner Help</h1>
<p>This is a temporary help page while I get around to writing the proper one.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We want to create <i>soaring tasks</i> in MSFS as simply as possible, e.g. a three-waypoint task could be created
    with three clicks on a map.
</p>

<p> Soaring tasks benefit from additional information embedded into the MSFS .pln file so the soaring Nav gauges and other
    addons (e.g. ALBATROSS) can pick up this information. Sticking with the MSFS '.pln' format gives us the maximum
    compatibility and flexibility with MSFS and other flight planning tools. The soaring parameters need to be passed to the
    aircraft without corruption by MSFS - these include:
    <ul>
        <li>the <i>elevation</i> of the waypoint</li>
        <li>the <i>radius</i> of the waypoint (i.e. how close the pilot must get to the WP to confirm having reached it)</li>
        <li><i>minimum and maximum altitudes</i> required at the WP.</li>
    </ul>
     This is done in an upwards-compatible way, so an ordinary MSFS waypoint with no additional
    soaring parameters will work fine and the parameters will be given default values.
</p>

<p>The 'additional' soaring parameters in the flight plan are entirely optional, and the B21 Task Planner can equally produce a valid MSFS
    flight plan with none of these parameters provided. When the optional parameters <i>are</i> provided, and encoded into the waypoint
    name, custom soaring gauges in the aircraft (such as the B21 Nav Panel) can pick those parameters out of the name and display the
    name <i>without</i> the parameters to the pilot in the gauge, i.e. a waypoint called "*Burnt Cabins+2310|6000/1000x800" will be
    displayed in the cockpit as "Burnt Cabins".
</p>

<h2>Units used for the additional soaring parameters</h2>

<p>The B21 Task Planner allows the user to choose the units they want to input/see for altitude (meters or feet) and distance (kilometers
    or miles). However, when these values are encoded into the MSFS flight plan WP name, altitude/elevation will be in
    <i>feet MSL</i> and distances will be in <i>meters</i>.
</p>

<h2>Default values for the soaring parameters</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>WP elevation</td>
        <td>For an <i>airport</i> the default elevation will be the ground elevation for the airport defined by MSFS. In most
            circumstances this should work great. For a user waypoint, the ground elevation will default to 0 MSL.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WP max altitude</td>
        <td>no limit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WP min altitude</td>
        <td>no limit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WP radius</td>
        <td>500 meters</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>The MSFS .pln format, with extensions for the soaring parameters</h2>

<p>To pass these additional parameters through to MSFS and the aircraft, while ensuring the flight plan remains completely compatible
    with 'plain vanilla' MSFS, the B21 Task Planner encodes the additional parameters into the <i>name</i> assigned to the waypoint.
</p>

<p><b>*</b> is used to flag a WP as the Start or Finish of the task, <i>prepended to the name</i>, e.g. "*Burnt Cabins" will imply the
    "Burnt Cabins" waypoint is the start or finish (the first *WP will be the start, the second one will be the finish)
</p>

<p><b>+</b> indicates the <i>elevation in feet</i> of the waypoint, e.g. "Burnt Cabins+2310" implies the "Burnt Cabins" waypoint is at
    2310 feet.
</p>

<p><b>|</b> indicates the <i>max altitude in feet</i> permitted at the waypoint.
</p>

<p><b>/</b> indicates the <i>min altitude in feet</i> permitted at the waypoint.
</p>

<p><b>x</b> any time after the <b>|</b> indicates the <i>radius of the waypoint in meters</i>
</p>

<table>

    <tr>
        <td>Burnt Cabins</td><td>A waypoint with the default values for the soaring parameters (e.g. a waypoint elevation of 0 MSL)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>*Burnt Cabins</td><td>This waypoint is the start or finish WP of the task.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Burnt Cabins+2310</td><td>The elevation of the WP is 2310 feet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Burnt Cabins|6000</td><td>The WP has a max altitude of 6000 feet MSL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Burnt Cabins/1000</td><td>The WP has a min altitude of 1000 feet MSL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Burnt Cabins|x800</td><td>The WP has a turn radius of 800 meters. The <b>|</b> is required anywhere <i>before</i> the <b>x</b>,
        which can most simply achieved by adding the turn radius after the other WP parameters.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">*Burnt Cabins+2310|6000/1000x800"</td><td>The WP "Burnt Cabins" is a start or finish waypoint, at an elevation of
            2310 feet MSL, a maximum turn altitude of 6000 feet, a minimum turn altitude of 1000 feet, and a turn radius of 800 meters. </td>
